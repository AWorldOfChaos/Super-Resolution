## **Git and Github**

We'll start by learning version control as it's really important to maintain and organize projects.

## **Python Basics**

- A good place to start with Python coding is the micro-course on Python, available on Kaggle. It provides tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and hands-on coding experience in the form of Kaggle kernels, which are modeled as Jupyter notebooks too. Here is the link: [https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
- Following tutorials from the Krittika Summer Projects Tutorials are relevant for the purpose of this project: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14. Here is the link: [https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials](https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials)
- An alternative, to those who prefer youtube, can utilize the following video

## **Supplementary Material for Probability**

Brushing up on probability, and understanding common probability distributions will help you understand and appreciate the concepts better. I'm attaching a few resources you can refer to for brushing up on probability. You can go through them at your own pace.
